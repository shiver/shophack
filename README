ShopHack

ShopHack is a Nethack spoiler which can be used to aid in the identification of items by
pricing. This is by no means a new type of application and there are already existing
products which offer the exact same (if not better) service. Shophack aims to be
different by being useable offline (no internet) and with one or two unique features
that will hopefully come in handy.

The project was intended to aid my playing and not really for distibution to others.
However, if you do use it, I'd love to hear about it :) Suggestions and assistance is 
more than welcome.

Happy hacking!
